//Intro
A hero lost
his magic watch
in this dungeon
(Foto dell'eroe che fugge e gli cade l'orologio)


And a slime found it:
"WOW, this is surely going to help me
free myself and run away from this dungeon"
(Foto dello slime davanti all'orologio)


He picked it up and decided to use it
against the dungeon boss.
He was sure that this would have
helped him thanks to its power,
although he didn't really know it...

He decide to go through the rooms and the puzzles
To arrive to the boss and defeat him
